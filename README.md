# File format change

A Symfony CLI application that imports the attached XML file, converts it to another file format and saves it again.
- It should be able to output CSV, Excel and Json.
- The only two parameters of the application should be:
    - File path
    - The output format
- The output file should be saved in the same directory as the source file.

The following requirements:
- Easily expandable
- SOLID
- Testability
